PLP - PERL IN HTML PAGES

PLP is yet another Perl embedder, primarily for HTML documents. Unlike
with other Perl embedders, there is no need to learn a meta-syntax or
object model: one can just use the normal Perl constructs. PLP runs
under FastCGI and mod_perl for speeds comparable to those of PHP, but
can also be run as a standard CGI script.
