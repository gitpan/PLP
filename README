DESCRIPTION
    PLP is yet another Perl embedder, primarily for HTML documents. Unlike
    with other Perl embedders, there is no need to learn a meta-syntax or
    object model: one can just use the normal Perl constructs. PLP runs
    under mod_perl for speeds comparable to those of PHP, but can also be
    run as a CGI script.
