used in this document are available (for free) at CPAN: http://search.cpan.org/

=item send a cookie

    <: 
	BEGIN {
	    use CGI::Cookie;
	    AddCookie( CGI::Cookie->new(
		-name => 'ID',
		-value => 123456,
		-domain => 'foo.com',
		-path => '/'
	    )->as_string );
	}
    :>

=item get a cookie

    Your user ID is <:= $cookie{ID} :>

=item set a header

    <:
	BEGIN {
	    $header{Content_Type} = 'text/plain';
	}
    :>

=item use a database

Use DBI, and alternatively, one of the many simplifying modules. Drivers for
DBI are in the DBD:: namespace. DBI loads the driver automatically, but it has
to be available.

    <:
	use DBIx::Simple; # and read its documentation for examples.
    :>

=item allow a user to upload a file

Use CGI.pm, which can be used with CGI::Upload to make things easier

    <:
	use CGI;         # and don't use %post in your PLP document.
	use CGI::Upload; # and read its documentation for examples.
	my $cgi = CGI->new;
	my $upload = CGI::Upload->new($cgi);
	...
    :>
=item download a file into a variable

    <:
	use LWP::Simple;
	my $page = get("http://foo.com/bar.html");
    :>
